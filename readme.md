# concurrent_channel

Simple, thread safe shell-pipe like abstraction for queues.

**REVIEWS WANTED**

## Using

Check this repository out recursively, add `include/` and
`vendor/concurrentqueue/` to your include paths.

```c++
#include "softwear/concurrent_channel.hpp"
// Holding 80K elements, polling every half millisecond
softwear::concurrent_channel<int>{80000, 500};
```

## Features

*Taken from the API documentation; in case of doubt, the API
doc is authoritative*

Beyond a basic concurrent queue functionality, this
provides flow control and end-of-transmission signaling
between threads, specifically:
* Support for a simple capacity limit
* Support for enqueue methods that block if the channel is at capacity
* Support for dequeue methods that block if no data is available in the channel
* Support for a close() method and an eof() check to
  allow provider threads to signal that there is no more
  data to process.

## Motivation

*Taken from the API documentation; in case of doubt, the API
doc is authoritative*

Moodycamel's pipe is excellent, but a bit complex to use:

**Why a simple capacity limit?**
Personally, I implemented this for an application that red
data via network, ran some heavy computation on the data
then sent it to another network host: I started a couple of
IO threads for loading, a couple to send the processed data
and a couple for the actual processing, with a channel between
each step. If fetching or the data processing where slow,
the other threads would implicitly wait for them. If the
processing or fetching where to fast, they would
automatically stop and wait for the other threads, so no
thread can fill up all the ram.

**Why close signaling?**
After the last fetching thread is done, it signals that the
job is done to processing; processing in turn can forward
the signal to the uploader, so in the management thread very
little effort is needed: It needs to set up the channel and
start the threads, then it just need to join() all the
threads and exit as soon as all the threads are don.

## Example

See tests.cc for an example.

## Documentation

`include/softwear/concurrent_queue.hpp` contains detailed
documentation.

## Testing

Run `make`.

## TODO

* Allocator support (doable through the malloc/free in the Traits)
* Locking based implementation
* More precise size computation for the internal queue
  (avoiding malloc)
* Update the documentation to reflect all information from
  Concurrentqueue
* **Reviews**
